# World Authoring Report

## Creator workflow readiness
- World save/load uses deterministic snapshot hashes for save, load, clone, export template, import template, and share template workflows.
- Terrain and region authoring includes terrain, region, resource, spawn, civilization territory painting, and partition visualization.
- Undo/redo keeps deterministic stacks, batch action lineage, and restore points.

## Publish readiness
- Creator-facing flows favor single-action validation and deterministic packaging before any deployment-visible state changes.
- Publish operations remain driven by explicit pipeline stages and produce reproducible lineage hashes.

## EverNode readiness
- EverNode deployment UX hides infrastructure details while preserving validation, signing, deployment, verification, publishing, deployment history, and rollback visibility.

## Runtime safety guarantees
- Editor surfaces are projection-only where they visualize runtime state.
- Replay history remains append-only and visually navigable without rewrite privileges.
- Runtime authority remains with the deterministic execution runtime; editor actions are validated inputs rather than direct authority mutations.
- Serialization, terrain generation, asset import, undo/redo, and world template workflows use deterministic hashes.

## Remaining limitations
- This milestone records creator-grade deterministic scaffolding and validation surfaces; renderer, history, and federation remain scaffold-level runtime domains.
- Full production rendering, storage backends, network deployment, and marketplace services require integration with the mature runtime services as they graduate from scaffold status.

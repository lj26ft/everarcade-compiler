# Determinism Report

Status: Phase II local benchmark run completed.

## Scope

This report summarizes Continuum Boundary Benchmark Phase II probes for independent review. Raw local artifacts are excluded from git and were written under:

- Logical CPUs: `3`

## Findings

Five deterministic replay probes produced matching roots. Root: `740417943b242ac246e70f422f416b25eb6265d282006f011b8c3d2f3c89d2f6`. Any future mismatch in this section is a protocol-blocking failure until explained.

## Raw artifact references
